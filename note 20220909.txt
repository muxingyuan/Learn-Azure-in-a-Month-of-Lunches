Chapter 12

1. When you work with VMs in the cloud, it's often hard to 
troubleshoot a problem when you can't physically see the computer
screen, the way you can get web app diagnostics.

2. One of the most common issues with VMs is lack of connectivity.
If you can't SSH or RDP to a VM, how can you troubleshoot what's
wrong?  One of the first things you may want to check is whether
the VM is running correctly.  To help, Azure provides VM boot
diagnostics that include boot logs and a screenshot of the console.

3. You do need to create a storage account for the boot logs and 
console screenshots, but the cost to store this data is likely 
less than $0.01 per month unless you have a busy VM that generate a 
lot of data.

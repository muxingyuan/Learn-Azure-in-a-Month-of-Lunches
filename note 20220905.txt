Chapter 10

1. The unstructured data in NoSQL databases isn't stored in tables of rows and columns;
rather, it's stored in dynamic arrays that allow you to add new properties for an item
as needed.

2. Xingyuan, happy to read more from this book's angle about NoSQL DB.

3. This chapter uses an SQL model for Cosmos DB, but the data is stored in a NoSQL JSON
format.  These may be new concepts, but stick with me.  You can use other models, 
including Mongo, Cassandra, Gremlin, and Table.  The functionality is the same for all
of them: pick your model, choose your regions, and add your data.  That's the power of 
Cosmos DB.

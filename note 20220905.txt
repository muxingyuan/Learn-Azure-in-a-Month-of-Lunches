1. With cloud computing and virtualization, the challenges of scaling horizontally
are minimized to the point that you can often scale horizontally more quickly than
vertically and without downtime.

2. VMs have a cool cousin in Azure that can help you out here: virtual machine scale sets.

3. az vmss create command created and configured a load balancer for you!

4. you can view your current quota for a given region as follows:
az vm list-usage --location westeurope
To request an increase in your quotas for a region, follow the steps outlined at

5. This cool-down period gives the new VM instances time to deploy and begin to receive
traffic from the load balancer, which should decrease the overall application 
load in the scale set.  Without this cool-down period, the rules may trigger another
VM instance to be added before the load has started to be distributed accross 
the previously created VM instance.

6. As with most things, the choice between IaaS and PaaS is a balance of flexibility
and ease of management.

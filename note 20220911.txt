1. One advantage of encrypting the entire VM is that you manage
the encryption keys.  These encryption keys are securely stored in 
Azure Key Vault, and you can choose between using software- and 
hardware-generated keys.

You control these keys, so you can define access to them and use
role-based access controls and auditing to track usage.

You can also rotate the encryption keys on a defined schedule,
much like changing your password every 60 or 90 days.

2. Microsoft manage the underlying Key Vault service but has no
access to the contents of the vaults.  This security boundary
means when you encrypt your data in Azure, you are the only 
one who can decrypt and view it.

chapter 3 Azure Web Apps
========================

6.  There will be  a cutoof on supported older vesions at a certain point.  
Again, that may be a time when you fall back to running IaaS VMs yourself.
But in that case, you are in a constant-maintenance approach (miserable situation).
Always look to move those legacy apps to more modern supported platforms.

Xingyuan: this statement makes me think it is like smart phone industry game that
hardware and app are always interactively updating, so that users are always staying 
at latest and greatest experience.
host hardware/cloud capability and web app is the just the same industry game.
However, in the backend of major banks, governments, large enterprises, there are their
respective core business application, that are so old but so crucially core to the business
so that no one want to risk updating them with new stack... as long as it runs ...

Just like licensed and open-source will continue to live peacefully together,
cloud hosting and on-prem hosting will be the world even in future, just the portion percentage
is leaning more to cloud.

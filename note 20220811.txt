1. you can start to make informed decisions as to when to build and run a VM to power
a website (IaaS) and when you might use PaaS to do so.

2. create a basic VM, log in to install a web server, and then open a network port 
to allow customers to browse the simple website.

Ubuntu is a common web server platform, and it's a great way to learn about SSH

4. to connect to backend database or application servers, need:
either VPN connection,
or dedicated connection to Azure from on-prem networking equipment, in Azure this dedicated 
connection is called ExpressRoute.

5. a basic web server requires a specific type of virtual IP address: a public IP address.
behind it control the flow of traffic to your VM with NSGs (network security groups).
by default NSG lock down traffice and allow only specific traffic defined by admin.
Common traffic to define is HTTP or HTTPS on TCP ports 80 and 443.
RDP or SSH can also be defined.

6. use SSH key pairs to authenticate to Linux VM
vs
use password to authenticate to Windows Server

7. "You should always focus on security as a central concept, especially in the cloud."

1. With all the network components in place, you're ready to create two VMs.
One VM is created in the subnet that allows HTTP traffice so that you install
a web server.  The other VM is created in the subnet that allows SSH so that 
you have a jump box to further secure your application environment and begin to 
replicate a production depoyment.

2. SSH public-key pair: The private key is something that stays on your computer.
Only the public key is copied to the remote VMs.  Although the public key was added 
to both VMs you created, you can't just SSH to your jump box and then SSH to the web VM.
Why? That jump box doesn't have a copy of your private key.  When you try to make 
the SSH connection from the jump box, it has no private key to pair up with the 
public key on the web VM for you to authenticate.

3. The private key is something to safeguard, you shouldn't take the easy way out
by copying the private key to the jump box.  Any other users who access the jump box
could potentially get a copy of your private key and then impersonate you anywhere 
they key is used.

4. Here's where the SSH agent (for Linux only) comes into play.  If you run the SSH
agent in your Cloud Shell session, you can add your SSH keys to it.  To create your 
SSH connection to the jump box, you specify the use of this agent to tunnel your session.
This technique allows you to effectively pass through your private key for use from
the jump box to the web VM without ever copying the private key.

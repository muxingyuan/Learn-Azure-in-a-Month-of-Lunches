I have a website built by WorkPress uworks.ca, I would like to make it a website by my own coding.
I am certified Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer, so I am confident learning through this ebook while building my own website will be easier than others that do not have previous cloud experience.

I have the motivation of driving through this duo-project as fast as possible, since I would love to evolve to a Data Enginner from my current Business Intelligence Developer role.

At 20 of 370 of this ebook ^-^.  Happying reading and learning!

Xingyuan: now thinking might finish this book in 2 or 3 months
Xingyuan: as a data person, just run through chapter 7 and 8, not getting hands dirty.

Chapter 8

1. Load balancers in Azure can work at two levels: layer 4, where just the network traffic 
is examined and distributed (the transport layer); and layer 7, where there's an awareness
of the application data within the network traffic to help determine the distribution of data.

2. A load balance consists of a few main components:
Frontend IP pool;
Health probes;
Load-balancer rules;
Network Address Translation (NAT) rules;
Backend IP pool.

3. Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer that works at the application layer
(layer 7).  Application Gateway gains insight into the application that runs on the VM 
and can manage the traffice flows in more advanced ways.  One major benefit of 
Application Gateway is the ability to handle encrypted, HTTPS web traffice.
When you load-balance websites with SSL certificates, you can offload the process
the verifies and decrypts the traffice from the web servers.  On websites with a lot of 
SSL traffic, the process to verify and decrypt the traffic can consume a large portion
of compute time on the VMs or web apps.  Application Gateway can verify and decrypt
the traffic, pass the pure web request to the web servers, and then reencrypt the traffic
received from the web servers and return it to the customer.

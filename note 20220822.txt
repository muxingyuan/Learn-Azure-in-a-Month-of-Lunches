page 65 (90 of 370) before Here is what happens to each network packet:

1. Network resources exist separately from VM resources and can persist 
beyond the lifecycle of a given VM.  This concept allows you to create
fixed network resources, and create, delete and create again a VM that
maintains the same network reources, such as IP addresses and DNS names.
Think of a lab VM or a development-and-test environment.  You can reproduce
the exact same environment quickly because only the VM changes.

2. Why .4? What about the first three address in the address space? 
Azure reserves the first three IP addresses in each range for its own
management and routing.  The first usable address you can use in each 
range is 4.
